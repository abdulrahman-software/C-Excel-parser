# C-Excel-parser

**C-Excel-parser** — a lightweight console C++ parser for Excel-exported CSV files, built as a student/learning project that demonstrates common data-structures and algorithms for efficient data handling (linked lists, stacks, queues, hashing, graphs, and self-balancing trees). ([GitHub][1])

## Project overview

This project implements a console-based parser (written in C++) intended to read and process structured datasets exported from Excel as CSV. It was implemented to showcase use of classical data structures and algorithms to store, query, and manipulate parsed records. The repository currently contains the main source `Labfinal.cpp`, sample data `bank.csv`, and a compiled executable (for convenience/test). ([GitHub][1])

---

## Features

* Parses CSV files exported from Excel.
* Demonstrates use of: linked lists, stacks, queues, hashing, graphs, and self-balancing trees.
* Example CLI-driven interactions (search, insert, delete, traversal — depending on what's implemented in `Labfinal.cpp`).
* Includes sample CSV data for quick testing. ([GitHub][1])

## Repository structure

```

├─ .vscode/                      # editor settings (optional)
├─ Labfinal.cpp                  # main C++ source file (parser + algorithms)
├─ Labfinal.exe                  # compiled binary (Windows)
├─ bank.csv                      # sample data (CSV exported from Excel)

(Adapt if you rename or reorganize files.) ([GitHub][1])

## Prerequisites

* A C++ compiler (g++, clang++, or MSVC).
* Recommended: compile with C++17 or later.

On Debian/Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential
```

On macOS (with Homebrew):

```bash
brew install gcc
```

---

## Build & Run

### Compile with g++

From repository root:

```bash
# compile
g++ -std=c++17 Labfinal.cpp -O2 -o c_excel_parser


./c_excel_parser bank.csv
```

If you are on Windows and want to use provided `Labfinal.exe`:

```powershell
.\Labfinal.exe bank.csv
```

> Tip: If `Labfinal.cpp` expects specific command-line arguments, check the top of the source for `main()` signature or any README comments — adjust the run command accordingly.

---

## Usage example

Assuming the program accepts a CSV path as the first argument:

```bash
# parse sample file
./c_excel_parser bank.csv

```

The program’s runtime menu or console output will usually describe available commands (search records, list all, insert, delete, save, etc.). If the repo’s `Labfinal.cpp` contains interactive prompts, follow them on-screen.

---

## How it works (high level)

1. **Parsing** — the program reads CSV rows line-by-line and splits fields (commonly by comma, with simple handling for quoted fields).
2. **In-memory structures** — parsed rows are stored in data structures that illustrate common CS concepts: linked lists for sequential data, hashing for quick lookups, stacks/queues for LIFO/FIFO operations, and trees/graphs for hierarchical or related-data tasks.
3. **Operations** — the program exposes algorithms to manipulate the dataset (search, insertion, deletion, traversal, aggregation).
4. **Output** — operations results are printed to the console, and optionally can be saved/exported.

> The exact behavior depends on the implementation in `Labfinal.cpp`; inspect the source to see available CLI commands and function names. ([GitHub][1])

---

## Testing data

* `bank.csv` is included as a sample dataset; use it to test parsing and algorithm behavior. ([GitHub][1])

---

## Notes & recommendations

* **Remove/exclude compiled binaries** from source control (e.g., `Labfinal.exe`) and add them to `.gitignore`. Distributing binaries in a repo can make repository size grow and may raise security concerns. Prefer releasing binaries as GitHub Releases if you want to share builds.
* Consider splitting large monolithic source files into modules (e.g., `parser.cpp/h`, `structures/*.cpp/h`) for readability and maintainability.
* Add automated tests (unit tests) for parser edge-cases (quoted fields, embedded commas, newlines in quotes).
* Add a proper `LICENSE` file (MIT / Apache-2.0 / GPL) to clarify reuse terms.
* Add a short `USAGE.md` or inline help in the binary explaining expected CSV column order/headers.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Suggested workflow:

1. Fork the repo.
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/parse-improvements`
3. Commit changes and push to your fork.
4. Open a Pull Request describing your changes.

If you want me to add CI (GitHub Actions) to auto-compile and unit test the code, tell me what compiler/platform to target and I can provide a ready `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
